# Ecommerce-Django
This project is a fully functional e-commerce web application built using Python Django framework with a focus on scalable backend architecture, robust database design, and modular application structure. 
It provides core functionalities expected in modern online stores such as user management, product browsing, cart and favorites handling, 
category-wise navigation, and stock control, while ensuring maintainability and extendability.
The backend is integrated with MySQL for structured data handling and uses Pillow for image uploads, with enhanced admin interface via Jazzmin. All views are dynamic and follow Djangoâ€™s MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm.
